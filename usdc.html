  <h1>USDC: The Future of Finance</h1>
    <p>Program my money! Take it from my bank account and move it where it needs to be. I don't care if it's decentralized; I don't care if you need my driver's license – I need you to move it where it needs to be.</p>
    <p>Synapse, the largest BaaS provider in the world ($76 billion volume p.a.) <a href="https://synapsefi.com/">[1]</a>, has recently collapsed spectacularly. Currently a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, millions of end-user funds are in limbo while Synapse and its banking partner Evolve figure out where to place the blame <a href="https://medium.com/synapsefi/addressing-evolves-misleading-press-release-8e8b77850a7a">[2]</a>. Balance discrepancies, late settlements, and lost funds have plagued U.S. fintech since its inception, all boiling down to one fundamental issue – if you want to make money programmable, you need to use programmable money. You cannot use centralized balance ledgers and rely on trust for settlement. The money must be programmable.</p>
    <p>Given this truth, why would we use brokerage accounts connected to FBO accounts with layers of APIs? Two reasons: (1) fintech developers were unaware of crypto's capabilities, and (2) crypto wasn't ready. While fintech allowed for composable transactions—Uber pushing funds to your account, your insurance pulling money from it, or you sending cash to a friend on Venmo—this level of interoperation was impossible with crypto until now.</p>
    <p><strong>Enter Circle and USDC.</strong></p>
    <p>Jeremy Allaire and his team are on a mission to create a pseudo-CBDC—highly regulated yet completely trustworthy. With the launch of Circle Mint, companies using USDC can now off-ramp and on-ramp dollars to blockchains in seconds via an API. Circle positions itself as the future of fintech—in essence, the future of finance.</p>
    <p>Some simple axioms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fintech currently exists with a clear product-market fit – we want to move our dollars.</li>
        <li>Fintech uses outdated payment rails, prone to balance discrepancies and reliant on trust.</li>
        <li>Blockchains offer rails with no balance discrepancies and are trustless, but require a stable coin and a way to on-ramp/off-ramp that coin.</li>
        <li>Circle offers that coin and the ramps.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a simple formula for how to deliver actual services to real people – payroll, financing, banking, and transacting. In essence, the formula for programmable money has been outlined by fintech already, but it uses archaic methods and it's only a matter of time until it's replaced by the given gift of God (Vitalik). But consensus, shards, proofs, and rollups are nothing without actual use cases. The actual use cases are all driven by the need for solid ramps and stable currency.</p>
    <p>Long story short, we're long on Circle and accept Allaire as our panopticon leader. The money needs to be programmed and moved where it needs to be. Blockchains provide the rails, but USDC is the vehicle that everyone can trust and utilize.</p>
