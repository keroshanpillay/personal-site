    <h1 id="positive-feedback">Positive Feedback</h1>
        <p>In life, there are cycles that compound on themselves. Said another way, doing this thing makes you more likely to do said thing. This is most commonly discussed in biology but I&#39;ve found it particularly pertinent to philosophy and finance. Oftentimes positive feedback is a negative experience on long timeframes. For example, if you are short on the rent and decide to get an advanced deposit, you now not only have the rent to pay back but the insane interest that would be charged on top of that. But you didn&#39;t have enough money to begin with, right? So you&#39;ll have to borrow more for the next time, owing more with more interest. This is a spiral that sends you directly to the middle of the Earth and really makes life horrible. </p>
        <p>What&#39;s worse is that this exists everywhere and people prey on cycles like these to ruin you. Gambling, drugs, porn to name a few. Countless lives have been ruined because of phenomenons like these and they are incredibly hard to end. There are also extended cycles of ill positive feedback. Let&#39;s assume that intellectual ability is approximately indicative of the University you attend. Graduating from a top-tier University makes it easy to get a job, mostly because of reputation and status. But the people graduating from here are actually the top pool of talent. So, likely, even without the stamp of approval, this bunch would have been the most likely to make a plan to get a job regardless. But, alas, they have it easy and get jobs. However, the people who could not get into a good college, now have a much more difficult task in getting a good job; but they are &#39;less talented&#39;. So you end up getting a terrible job with no social mobility, you have to work long hours, and that limits your ability to look for jobs elsewhere. Your fate is damn near decided unless you have some extraordinary outlook to change this. </p>
        <p>Whether this phenomenon is natural or constructed, I don&#39;t know. But it certainly exists and you have to stay careful to not find yourself walking down the staircase. </p>
        <p>However, thankfully, you can also leverage positive feedback to better your life. You want to do actions in your day that will make tomorrow easier. For example, eating healthily makes you feel better and makes you more likely to make good decisions tomorrow – like eating healthy again. It&#39;s compound interest. It&#39;s actually easiest seen in finance, again, where if you save money to a compounding account, you have a good chance of retiring wealthy. Actually, I read this Einstein quote from a while back which has stuck with me</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn&#39;t … pays it.” </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Apart from the masculine pronouns – come on Einstein! – there&#39;s a good point here. You want to &#39;earn&#39; because of your relationships, worldview, account, etc. You absolutely do not want to pay because of them. Of course, easier said than done and it&#39;s because it takes a great deal of self-control and willpower to transcend your natural instincts that incentivize positive feedback. Said another way, after you lose all your money gambling, it&#39;s increasingly difficult to not <em>want</em> to make it back in one trade. But this is where I believe that stratification of people comes from: from those who can control their instincts and therefore compounding. </p>
