  <h1>Consumer Choice as Political Expression</h1>
  <p>This whitepaper explores how purchasing decisions function as political mechanisms, particularly examining whether consumer behavior in competitive markets can influence corporate lobbying practices and indirectly shape policy.</p>
  <p>Major corporations allocate substantial resources to lobbyingâ€”McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble each spend between $1.1 million and $3.7 million annually. Research indicates "60% of consumers are willing to pay a premium for brands that reflect their values."</p>
  <p>The analysis draws on consumer sovereignty theory, stakeholder capitalism, and Hirschman's "Exit, Voice, and Loyalty" model, suggesting purchasing patterns can realign corporate political activity through market mechanisms.</p>
  <p>The Nike-Kaepernick case demonstrates how brand-aligned campaigns generated significant sales increases, though boycott effectiveness remains limited without sustained coordination.</p>
